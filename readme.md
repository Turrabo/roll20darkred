### What is this?
This is a Stylus theme for Roll20, forked from Kirill S's incredible work originally posted [here](https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/7841113/show-off-your-style-2-the-stylening/?pageforid=8680812#post-8680812).
I've made my own tweaks, added styles for several extra components, and shifted the theme to red.


### What does this theme do?

- **Overhauls the look and feel of the entire Roll20 playspace.**
- **New typography** - Custom fonts have been included for headers, numbers, and main text, with several custom icons. Everything's less "default" feeling.
- **Dark theme** - Modern, dark UI, with accents in the official DnD red. This affects most of the main elements of the player-facing UI. I haven't tested this as a DM.
- **Cleaner chat** - More modern and easier to read. The chat panel has better spacing between blocks of text, and is easier to scan at a glance with clear numbers.
- **5e DND charsheet** - Numerous tweaks to the 5E character sheet, making it tidier and clearer to read.

### Disclaimer
This hasn't been tested with any other sheets or games. This has also been designed primarily as a player, there may well be several DM-focused elements which are broken by this theme.
